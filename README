readtaken and readnottaken:
	These functions calculate branch predictions based on a simple rule:
        readtaken counts a branch as taken (T) and increments a counter when the "behavior" field in the trace file is "T."
        readnottaken counts a branch as not taken (NT) and increments a counter when the "behavior" field in the trace file is "NT."

bimodal:
        This function implements a bimodal predictor with various table sizes (e.g., 16, 32, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 entries).
        It uses a table of counters (initialized to true) and a hash function to index the table based on the address.
        For each branch in the trace file, it checks whether the prediction in the table matches the actual behavior. If they match, it increments the correct predictions counter. If not, it updates the table.

twobit:
        This function implements a two-bit predictor with various table sizes.
        It uses a table of two-bit saturating counters for each table entry.
        For each branch in the trace file, it checks the counter's value in the table based on the address and updates the counter according to the actual behavior (taken or not taken).
        It also keeps track of correct predictions based on the counter's state.

gshare:
        This function implements a gshare predictor with different global history register (GHR) sizes (ranging from 2^3 to 2^11).
        It uses a table of two-bit saturating counters and combines the global history register with the address to index the table.
        For each branch in the trace file, it updates the GHR and uses it to index the table.
        It checks whether the prediction in the table matches the actual behavior and increments the correct predictions counter accordingly.

tournament:
        This function combines the bimodal and gshare predictors to create a tournament predictor.
        It maintains separate tables for bimodal and gshare predictors as well as a selector table.
        For each branch in the trace file, it makes predictions using both predictors and then uses the selector table to choose which prediction to use.
        It tracks correct predictions based on the selected prediction.

btb:
        This function implements a branch target buffer (BTB) predictor with 512 entries.
        It uses a table to store target addresses for taken branches.
        For each branch in the trace file, it checks the BTB for the predicted target address based on the branch's address.
        It compares the predicted target with the actual target and increments the correct predictions counter if they match.
